The role of computer hardware and operating systems in IT support.

Computer hardware and operating systens play a HUGE role in IT support. One major example of this is that if there wasnt access to computer hardware or replacement parts, or diagnostic tools for IT support techs
to use, then they would not be able to fix issues nearly as easily. Another major example is that operating systems are essential to technology, all of the main tech that is used in IT support runs on operating
systems and without them they would have no access to computers or tech support in the first place. They also would not be able to look up or research potential fixes to problems that arrise.
