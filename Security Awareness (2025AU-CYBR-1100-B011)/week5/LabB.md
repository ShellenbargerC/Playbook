Create a .md file for your google search of your name to describe what you found, put this into Week 5 and submit the link here.
When I search my name not much comes up except for my linkedin. And all of the sites mentioning my name are incorrect in their addresses phone numbers etc. 

Find the most absurd law for your city, then for your state put it into the document that you just created.
In my city parties can be shut down if they are considered a nuisence despite time of day. And in my state its illegal to get a fish drunk.
