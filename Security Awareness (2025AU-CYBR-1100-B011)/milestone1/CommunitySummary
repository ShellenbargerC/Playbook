The business that I chose to focus on for my Community Summary is Avalanche Pizza in athens Ohio. They are known for a mix of things. Mainly they are known for their pizzas and other menu items such as calzones
but they also do some outreach in the community outside of this. The setup of their shop is dependant mainly on online systems to run their order taking and operations. They take orders in a number of ways.
Some of the ways to order include at their point of sale system in person. They have online ordering as well via a system called ToastTab and they deliver themselves. One reason that Avalanche values its onlone
security and that security awareness is important for them is that they handle a large number of debit/credit cards from orders inside at their POS system. If an attacker were to hack into or place an 
adulterated device onto this card reader such as a card skimmer then they could steal the financial data and info of customers. This is actually not their largest reason to have a concern for cyber security
awareness. That would likely be their online sales and delivery portion. For online ordering they collect info such as customer name phone number email and address which is also a prime target for hackers who
try to stel information. All it takes is for one hacker to succeed in getting in to all of that valuable information which would also include online orders financial data and card numbers as well. The business
on top of all of this has to protect its own interest along with customers, they need to look out for fake invoice emails which often target small businesses as well. As for training I think they could take
actions such as bringing up these risks to employees and making sure every one is on the same page of protecting customer and business info and preventing physical methods of attach such as skimmers by doing a
regular check of their POS systems.
