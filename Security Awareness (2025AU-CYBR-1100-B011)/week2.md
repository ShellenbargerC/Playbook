Summary: What you learned about personal cyber risks and defenses.
Something I personally learned this week about personal cyber risks and defenses is how
much of password cracking and mistakes really come from humans and not machines. I am really
interested in the social engineering aspect of it all so far. 

Artifacts: Screenshots from your chosen Hands-On Project(s) and your Case Project.

Passwords: Password, Password123, RandomPassw0rd!25
How Secure Is My Password (www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/) - 22mins, 41 years,
93 trillion years. 

Password Checker Online (http://password-checker.online-domain-tools.com/) - 0% dangerous
low, 62% Fairly Good, 100% Excellent

The Password Meter (www.passwordmeter.com/) - would not connect.

I think that the Password Checker Online tool is the best of the three in my opinion. I felt
that it provided relevant information like what its issues are and ways to improve. I feel
that the other wine only providing a time estimate may be misleading if a password uses a
common phrase or some other bad security standard within it. 

Reflection: How your personal practices will change going forward.
I think I am going to start being more cautious about how much I use the same password for
different platforms. Tools like this and like haveIbeenpwned have sort of been eye opening.

AI Use Note: If AI tools were used, explain how.
I did use ai to help explain instructions for things that I didnt understand and to get
assistance with study and memorization.
